This is where I put some of the codes/functions I have built and used over the years.
It should be noted that only some parts of the codes are turned into functions and shown.
Even though no academic courseworks are submitted and non-confidential report code are 
used. 

EDIT: 
Finalized_3D_Visulization_OMD is the final code I have used for the 3D visulization. However it should be noted that there is 
a pre-processing stage necessary, which is not included.
